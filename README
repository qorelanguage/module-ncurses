ncurses module for Qore
version 0.1 by David Nichols

Requires qore 0.7.0 and ncurses or SYSV curses headers and libraries to build.

Documentation TBD

This module provides the "Panel" and "Window" classes along with many functions and constants - see test/ncurses.q and examples/hanio.q and examples/worms.q for more information. 

note that this module is still experimental due to the fact that I'm not sure if it's possible to safely enable threading without putting a big lock around every curses call.  Basically threading and curses do not mix.
if your ncurses is in a non-standard location, set the NCURSES_DIR environment variable before running configure.  Also can be built with Solaris curses.

test script: test/ncurses.q
example scripts: examples/
